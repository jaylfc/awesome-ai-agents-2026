# Changelog

All notable changes to **Awesome AI Agents 2026** are recorded here.
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD  +Added  -Removed  ~Changed`.

## 2026-06-12 — Re-rank by strength / recency / popularity + readability polish (en/zh/ja sync)

### + Added (same day, third pass)

- **Anthropic** — [Claude Fable 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5) + [Claude Mythos 5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5) (June 9, 2026): Anthropic's first publicly available Mythos-class model and its restricted-access Project Glasswing sibling, added to the top of the Anthropic section in all three languages (en/zh/ja).

### ~ Changed (no entries removed; ordering, placement, and sync fixes only)

**Category re-ranking — newest/strongest first** (verified against June 2026 coverage: the frontier race is GPT-5.5 vs Claude Opus 4.8 vs Gemini 3.5):
- **Anthropic** — [Claude Opus 4.8](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus) (May 28, flagship, leads SWE-bench-class coding) moved from bottom of section to **#1**, ahead of Opus 4.7.
- **Google DeepMind** — [Gemini 3.5 Flash](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/sundar-pichai-io-2026/) + Gemini Omni / Omni Flash (I/O 2026) moved to top, ahead of Gemini 3.1 Pro.
- **OpenAI** — GPT-5.5 Instant (new ChatGPT default) promoted directly under the GPT-5.5 flagship trio.
- **xAI** — Grok 4.3 **GA** now leads the section ahead of the April beta entry.
- **DeepSeek** — V4-Pro / V4-Flash (the models) lead; the Agent-Harness hiring news follows.
- **IDE-Based Agents** — Cursor 3.4 / 3.3 / SDK (May 2026) moved above the older 3.09 entry.
- **Video Generation** — Runway Agent (May 13, first prompt-to-rough-cut production agent) leads the section.
- **MCP** — spec + 2026-07 RC restored to the top; the CorpusIQ community connector moved below official SDKs.

**Sync-drift repairs (zh-CN / ja, with README.md as source of truth):**
- De-duplicated **Claude Opus 4.8** (was listed twice in both zh-CN and ja Anthropic sections).
- Relocated ~18 entries that had piled up at the end of the 中国科学院/中国科学院 section (GPT-5.5 Instant, OpenAI Daybreak, Claude Finance Agents, Claude Add-ins/Dreaming, Mistral Medium 3.5, Voxtral TTS, Llama 5, MiniMax M2.5/M2.7/Hailuo 02/Music 2.6, Doubao 2.0, Seedance 2.0, Step 3.5 Flash, Baichuan-M3 Plus, Grok 4.3 GA) into their proper provider sections; added missing **StepFun** and **Baichuan** headings to zh-CN / ja to match README.md.
- Moved image-generation entries (Midjourney V8.1, Flux 2, Recraft V4, Kling IMAGE 3.0, Nano Banana 2, Sora 2 via Runway) that had drifted into the **Audio & Music** section of zh-CN / ja back into 图像生成 / 画像生成 and 视频生成 / 動画生成.
- Synced Coding Agents subsection placement: CLI tools (Codex Security, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Grok Build, Antigravity CLI, Kimi Code CLI, MAI-Code-1-Flash) now live under **Terminal / CLI**, IDE tools (Roo Code, Void, JetBrains Rider skill) under **IDE**, Devin 2.2 under **Autonomous SWE** — consistent across all three languages.
- Added **Goose** (Block) to README.md Terminal & CLI Agents — it existed only in zh-CN / ja.

**Header badges** — `Last Updated` → **June 12, 2026**, `Spam_Audited` → **2026-06-12** (all three READMEs).

**Follow-up sync pass (same day)** — added the three May-2026 Cursor entries (3.4 Teams + PR review / 3.3 / SDK) to the zh-CN and ja IDE sections (now 642 / 639 entries); fixed a ja typo in the Kiro entry (「最大3だ 10 タスク」→「最大 10 タスク」, plus 驅動→駆動); realigned zh-CN / ja ordering in 图像生成・视频生成・音频与音乐 / 画像生成・動画生成・音声・音楽 to match README.md.

- [Claude Opus 4.8](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus) (May 28, 2026) — codebase-scale migrations, **dynamic workflows** research preview that fans out hundreds of parallel sub-agents in one session, a manual **effort-control** panel, and **3× cheaper Fast mode** at the same $5 / $25 per million in/out. Live on Anthropic native + Amazon Bedrock + AWS Claude Platform + Google Cloud + Microsoft Foundry. Teases a forthcoming **Mythos-class** model line for limited orgs.

**Foundation Models — Google DeepMind** —
- [Gemini Omni Flash consumer rollout](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/317309/20260528/google-gemini-omni-flash-brings-voice-controlled-ai-video-editing-future-conversational-ai.htm) (May 28, 2026) — Omni Flash starts shipping to consumers in the Gemini app, **Google Flow**, and **YouTube Shorts** as the editing engine; conversational cinematic zooms / background swaps / weather edits driven by text + voice + image + audio prompts. Replaces traditional NLEs for short-form video.

**Agent Protocols & Standards** —
- [MCP 2026-07 Release Candidate](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/) (May 2026, final July 28, 2026) — next major MCP spec revision: **stateless protocol core**, **extensions framework**, **MCP Apps** (server-rendered UI), Tasks graduated to an extension, hardened authorization aligned with OAuth / OpenID Connect.

**Agent Frameworks** —
- [Koog 1.0](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog) (May 28, 2026, KotlinConf 2026) — JetBrains' open-source **Kotlin + Java** agent framework hits stable 1.0 with a 1-year API stability guarantee. Kotlin Multiplatform deployment (JVM / Android / iOS / JS / WASM), Java interop without wrapper modules, local Android LiteRT, OpenTelemetry across all targets, graph workflows, Spring Boot / Ktor integration, OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / Bedrock providers. Apache-2.0.

**Enterprise Agent Platforms** —
- [Sistava](https://sistava.com) (merged from community PR #24) — AI agent orchestration platform for deploying multi-channel sales / marketing / finance / support agents reachable via Slack, WhatsApp, email, voice, Telegram, API, MCP, A2A, webhooks, plus on-host computer use.

### ~ Changed

- **Header badges** — `Last Updated` → `May 30, 2026`, `Spam_Audited` → `2026-05-30`, `Resources` 435+ → **440+** (all three READMEs; zh-CN / ja now also carry the Resources badge).
- **2026 AI Timeline** — 5 new May 28–29 rows added across `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` / `README.ja.md`.

### ✕ Not added / held for revision (anti-spam holds)

- **PR #25 — CorpusIQ MCP** — marketing registry link returned **HTTP 404** at audit time, and the submission had no public artefact (no GitHub repo, no MCP Registry listing) beyond the corpusiq.io domain. Held with reviewer comment asking for a primary source.
- **PR #26 — AgentGate** — the patch inserts the same entry twice in the Agent Security section, mixes bullet styles (`*   [...]` vs `- [...]`), and drops a bare marketing URL on its own line. Underlying project (6 stars at audit; created 2026-05-08; submitter disclosed parallel submissions to 15+ awesome lists) would land with ⚠️ **Unverified**. Held pending a clean single-bullet patch.
- **PR #27 — GreenOps Agent** — repository created 2026-05-26 (4 days old at submission) with 0 stars, branch name `greenops-zijian` shows the submission is tailored to this list rather than reflecting external adoption, patch uses a doubled bullet prefix (`- - [...]`), and the quality-checklist line for third-party adoption is checked without linked evidence. Held with reviewer comment asking for primary sources.
- **"PilotDeck" (OpenBMB)** — covered by a single Medium write-up and the upstream GitHub README; needs an independent primary source describing scope and a clear license before listing.
- **"MiniMax M3"** — only a teaser as of late May 2026; no public weights, no API, no model card. Will revisit on launch (second half of 2026 per MiniMax).
- **"ChatGPT-5.5" / "Claude 4.8" lifestyle-blog round-ups** — secondary, non-authoritative listicles; relying on first-party announcements (covered above) instead.

### ✕ Closed without merge / list (PR & issue triage)

- **PR #19** MisarBlog — closed. Quality-gate fail: 0 GitHub stars on `mrgulshanyadav/misarblog-mcp`, single maintainer of an unknown project (sole-maintainer rule), proposed entry used a table format inconsistent with the surrounding bullet-list section. Same author has filed parallel submissions across 5+ awesome lists in the past two months (`punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`, `jaw9c/awesome-remote-mcp-servers`, `e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents`, `caramaschiHG/awesome-ai-agents-2026`, etc.). Welcome to re-submit once third-party adoption is verifiable.
- **Issue #16** Nobulex (Trust Capital) — closed as duplicate. Already listed in Agent Security at line #506 with the `⚠️ Unverified` caveat covering the Microsoft AGT merge + npm download discrepancy + 15+ awesome-list blast. No new evidence in this issue.
- **Issue #20** Nobulex (Security & Governance) — closed as duplicate of #16; same submitter / project / claim already audited.

## 2026-05-10 — Weekly refresh & PR audit

### — Closed (anti-spam policy)

Three open PRs were reviewed against the anti-spam contributor guidelines and **closed without merge**:

- **#13** *Add AI for Database* by `dann26parr69` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter account 2026-02-old, 0 followers, **20+ identical PRs across awesome-lists in 3 weeks** with multiple closures upstream; tool is a closed-source marketing site (no public repo).
- **#14** *feat: add P2PCLAW* by `Agnuxo1` — self-promotion; project description recycles previously-flagged BenchClaw, false claim of being "part of the OpenClaw family" (no relation to the listed [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)), benchmark numbers ("43× faster than PyTorch", "88.7% memory reduction") not independently reproduced.
- **#15** *Add Awesome AI Startups* by `ununununium` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter blast-PRed **20+ awesome lists in <1 hour** for `NotFair` MCP server. The proposed list itself (`nowork-studio/awesome-ai-startups`, CC0, 88 entries) is legitimate, but accepting parallel-blast PRs rewards spam behaviour. Closed per repository policy; the list may be added later by a non-spam contributor.

- **— Removed** — entry removed from the list (with reason).
- **~ Changed** — material wording, tagging, or link change.
- **Closed** — pull requests rejected (kept here for transparency).

## 2026-05-05 (Part 2) — Full Chinese + Japanese parity

### + Added

- `README.zh-CN.md` (中文版) — full parallel translation, 906 lines, 451
  entries across all 25 sections + 5 comparison tables + complete 2026
  timeline. No more "see English version" stubs.
- `README.ja.md` (日本語版) — full Japanese parallel translation, 909
  lines, same parity. Native technical Japanese with proper katakana
  conventions.
- Language-switch badges in all three READMEs cross-link to each other.

### Translation policy

  languages.
- All URLs identical; only entry descriptions translated.
- Minor differences allowed for natural reading (e.g., the Quick Nav
  table header is split differently in EN to fit the badge row).
- English README remains the source of truth — divergence is resolved
  in EN's favour.
