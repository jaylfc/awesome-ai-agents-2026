## 2026-05-10 — Weekly refresh & PR audit

### — Closed (anti-spam policy)

Three open PRs were reviewed against the anti-spam contributor guidelines and **closed without merge**:

- **#13** *Add AI for Database* by `dann26parr69` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter account 2026-02-old, 0 followers, **20+ identical PRs across awesome-lists in 3 weeks** with multiple closures upstream; tool is a closed-source marketing site (no public repo).
- **#14** *feat: add P2PCLAW* by `Agnuxo1` — self-promotion; project description recycles previously-flagged BenchClaw, false claim of being "part of the OpenClaw family" (no relation to the listed [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)), benchmark numbers ("43× faster than PyTorch", "88.7% memory reduction") not independently reproduced.
- **#15** *Add Awesome AI Startups* by `ununununium` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter blast-PRed **20+ awesome lists in <1 hour** for `NotFair` MCP server. The proposed list itself (`nowork-studio/awesome-ai-startups`, CC0, 88 entries) is legitimate, but accepting parallel-blast PRs rewards spam behaviour. Closed per repository policy; the list may be added later by a non-spam contributor.

### ~ Changed

- Added a **🏷️ Status Legend** (🆕 / 📦 Archived / 💤 Stale / ⚠️ Unverified / 🇨🇳 Chinese ecosystem) directly below the badges.
- Marked **4 archived projects** so readers know they are kept for historical reference only:
  - `gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer` (archived 2025-05)

- Marked **3 unverified entries** that were merged via parallel-blast PRs across many awesome lists. They are kept (not removed) so readers can see the projects, but with explicit caveats:
  - `The Colony` — submitted to 15+ awesome lists; org and SDK repos <30 days old, 0–2 stars each.
  - `BenchClaw` — submitted to 8 awesome lists, **rejected by 7**; single-maintainer with 2 stars.

- Updated Quick Navigation table to 25 categories and refreshed Contents list.

### — Closed

- PR #4 (`Add Web Agent Bridge (WAB)`) — closed as *not merged*. Description claimed `@wab/mcp-server` on npm (404), "180+ commits" (actual ~30), and the same PR was already rejected by `kyrolabs/awesome-agents`.

## How to read this file

- **+ Added** — new entry / new section.
- **— Removed** — entry removed from the list (with reason).
- **~ Changed** — material wording, tagging, or link change.
- **Closed** — pull requests rejected (kept here for transparency).

Status tag changes (from no-tag → 📦 / 💤 / ⚠️) are documented under "Changed" so readers can see when caveats were added.

## 2026-05-05 (Part 2) — Full Chinese + Japanese parity

### + Added

- `README.zh-CN.md` (中文版) — full parallel translation, 906 lines, 451
  entries across all 25 sections + 5 comparison tables + complete 2026
  timeline. No more "see English version" stubs.
- `README.ja.md` (日本語版) — full Japanese parallel translation, 909
  lines, same parity. Native technical Japanese with proper katakana
  conventions.
- Language-switch badges in all three READMEs cross-link to each other.
- Updated CONTRIBUTING reference to mention all three language versions
  share the same anti-spam quality gate.

### Translation policy

- All status tags (🆕 / 📦 / 💤 / ⚠️ / 🇨🇳) preserved verbatim across
  languages.
- All URLs identical; only entry descriptions translated.
- Minor differences allowed for natural reading (e.g., the Quick Nav
  table header is split differently in EN to fit the badge row).
- English README remains the source of truth — divergence is resolved
  in EN's favour.
