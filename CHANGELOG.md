**Notable Projects of 2026** — added OpenAI DeployCo, Anthropic ↔ SpaceX Colossus 1, DeepSeek $4B state-backed round, and the Vatican AI Commission announcement.

### ~ Changed

- **Header badges** — `Last Updated` and `Spam_Audited` bumped to `May 16, 2026` / `2026-05-16` across all three READMEs; `Resources` badge bumped 340+ → 360+.
- **Quick Navigation counts** — Foundation Models 65+ → 75+ (Sakana / Zyphra subsections + new Anthropic / OpenAI entries), Frameworks 22+ → 23+, Coding Agents 22+ → 24+, Physical AI 18+ → 19+, Computer Use 9+ → 10+, Enterprise 12+ → 14+.
- **2026 AI Timeline** — added 13 new May 11–16 rows across README.md / README.zh-CN.md / README.ja.md: SAP Sapphire 2026, Claude for Legal, Claude for Small Business, Cursor 3.4 environments, VS 2026 Agent Skills, Figure Helix 02 72h run, Anthropic ↔ Gates, Anthropic ↔ PwC, Genkit Middleware, Zyphra Diffusion, Pope Leo XIV's Vatican AI commission, OpenAI ↔ Malta, DeepSeek $4B raise.
- **zh-CN / ja parity** — mirrored every new English entry with locale-appropriate phrasing (not literal translation).

### ✕ Not added (explicit anti-spam holds)

- **Sakana "RL Conductor / Trinity" research paper** — listed as a model entry under the new Sakana AI section because the productised Fugu beta is in market; the underlying Conductor + Trinity research lives in the same entry rather than a separate "research only" bullet to avoid duplication.
- **Microsoft MDASH security harness** — acknowledged in the timeline (May 13) only inside the existing Microsoft Agent 365 row; not promoted to its own Security entry until a public artifact (paper / SDK) ships.
- **"OpenAI Daybreak EU expansion"** — covered by the existing May 12 Daybreak entry; no new bullet because the May 14-16 movement is incremental rollout, not a new product.

---

## 2026-05-15 — PR triage + May 11–14 expansion across 8 sections

- **Agent Frameworks** — [Bernstein](https://github.com/sipyourdrink-ltd/bernstein) (PR #18, 358 stars, Apache-2.0, deterministic CLI agent orchestrator with HMAC-chained audit, git worktree isolation; flagged for parallel blast across 8 awesome lists 2026-05-14 but passes quality gate).

### ✕ Closed without merge / list (PR & issue triage)

- **PR #19** MisarBlog — closed. Quality-gate fail: 0 GitHub stars on `mrgulshanyadav/misarblog-mcp`, single maintainer of an unknown project (sole-maintainer rule), proposed entry used a table format inconsistent with the surrounding bullet-list section. Same author has filed parallel submissions across 5+ awesome lists in the past two months (`punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`, `jaw9c/awesome-remote-mcp-servers`, `e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents`, `caramaschiHG/awesome-ai-agents-2026`, etc.). Welcome to re-submit once third-party adoption is verifiable.
- **Issue #16** Nobulex (Trust Capital) — closed as duplicate. Already listed in Agent Security at line #506 with the `⚠️ Unverified` caveat covering the Microsoft AGT merge + npm download discrepancy + 15+ awesome-list blast. No new evidence in this issue.
- **Issue #20** Nobulex (Security & Governance) — closed as duplicate of #16; same submitter / project / claim already audited.

## 2026-05-10 — Weekly refresh & PR audit

### — Closed (anti-spam policy)

Three open PRs were reviewed against the anti-spam contributor guidelines and **closed without merge**:

- **#13** *Add AI for Database* by `dann26parr69` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter account 2026-02-old, 0 followers, **20+ identical PRs across awesome-lists in 3 weeks** with multiple closures upstream; tool is a closed-source marketing site (no public repo).
- **#14** *feat: add P2PCLAW* by `Agnuxo1` — self-promotion; project description recycles previously-flagged BenchClaw, false claim of being "part of the OpenClaw family" (no relation to the listed [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)), benchmark numbers ("43× faster than PyTorch", "88.7% memory reduction") not independently reproduced.
- **#15** *Add Awesome AI Startups* by `ununununium` — fork named `awesome-ai-agents-2027`; submitter blast-PRed **20+ awesome lists in <1 hour** for `NotFair` MCP server. The proposed list itself (`nowork-studio/awesome-ai-startups`, CC0, 88 entries) is legitimate, but accepting parallel-blast PRs rewards spam behaviour. Closed per repository policy; the list may be added later by a non-spam contributor.

## How to read this file

- **+ Added** — new entry / new section.
- **— Removed** — entry removed from the list (with reason).
- **~ Changed** — material wording, tagging, or link change.
- **Closed** — pull requests rejected (kept here for transparency).

Status tag changes (from no-tag → 📦 / 💤 / ⚠️) are documented under "Changed" so readers can see when caveats were added.

## 2026-05-05 (Part 2) — Full Chinese + Japanese parity

### + Added

- `README.zh-CN.md` (中文版) — full parallel translation, 906 lines, 451
  entries across all 25 sections + 5 comparison tables + complete 2026
  timeline. No more "see English version" stubs.
- `README.ja.md` (日本語版) — full Japanese parallel translation, 909
  lines, same parity. Native technical Japanese with proper katakana
  conventions.
- Language-switch badges in all three READMEs cross-link to each other.
- Updated CONTRIBUTING reference to mention all three language versions
  share the same anti-spam quality gate.

### Translation policy

- All status tags (🆕 / 📦 / 💤 / ⚠️ / 🇨🇳) preserved verbatim across
  languages.
- All URLs identical; only entry descriptions translated.
- Minor differences allowed for natural reading (e.g., the Quick Nav
  table header is split differently in EN to fit the badge row).
- English README remains the source of truth — divergence is resolved
  in EN's favour.
