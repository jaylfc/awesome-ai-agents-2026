### 🏗️ Building: Coding Agents

**I want to build a coding agent for my startup (lowest cost, high quality)**
→ **Claude Code** (CLI) + **E2B** sandbox + **Langfuse** observability. SWE-bench 80.9%. ~$200/mo at moderate usage.

**I want an enterprise coding agent with security controls**
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise** — Deep GitHub integration, IP indemnity, SSO/SAML, SOC 2. → best if already on GitHub Enterprise
- **Cursor Business** — Privacy mode, code never leaves your infra, admin dashboard. → best for teams needing IDE-first UX
- **Devin 3.0** (Cognition) — Fully autonomous PR-to-merge with re-planning. → best for hands-off long-horizon tasks

**I want an open-source self-hosted coding agent (no vendor lock-in)**
- **OpenHands** (All-Hands-AI) — MIT, competitive SWE-bench, BYO model. → best if you need full control

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

**I want to run everything locally (privacy-first, zero cloud)**
→ **Ollama** (model runner) + **Open WebUI** (UI) + **Qdrant** (local vector DB) + **Qwen3.6-27B** (16GB VRAM) or **Llama 3.3 70B** (40GB+). Full stack: **OpenClaw** (local mode) or **AnythingLLM**. No data leaves your machine.

**I want to minimize API costs (budget <$50/month)**
→ Use **DeepSeek V3.2** ($0.14/$0.28) or **Gemini 2.5 Flash** ($0.30/$2.50) for high-volume. Reserve **Claude Sonnet 4.6** for complex tasks only. Use **Anthropic Batch API** (50% off) for non-real-time work. Cache aggressively (prompt caching saves ~70% on repeated context).

**I want to scale to enterprise (millions of requests/month)**
→ **Google Vertex AI** (managed Gemini, auto-scale, SLAs) or **Azure OpenAI** (GPT-4o, compliance, dedicated capacity). Add **LangFuse** for observability. For routing: **PortKey** or **LiteLLM** as unified gateway.

**I want to deploy in an air-gapped / regulated environment**
→ **Ollama** (local inference) + **Qwen3 235B A22B / Llama 3.3 70B** (open weights) + **Qdrant** (local vector DB). For enterprise needs: **IBM watsonx** (on-prem) or **Azure Government** (FedRAMP). Compliance certifications matter more than model quality here.

**I want to build for edge / mobile deployment**
→ **Core ML** (Apple, iOS/macOS) + **Phi-4 14B** or **Gemma 4 2B** (quantized). For Android: **MediaPipe** + **Gemma 4**. For cross-platform: **llama.cpp** + GGUF models. Check **Qualcomm AI Hub** for Snapdragon-optimized models.

**I need multi-cloud / want to avoid vendor lock-in**
→ **LiteLLM** (unified API proxy for 100+ providers) + **LangGraph** (framework-agnostic) + provider-agnostic embeddings (**BGE-M3** open-weight). Store all state in self-hosted **Qdrant** or **Postgres+pgvector**.

**I want to self-host everything (no managed services at all)**
→ **Ollama** (models) + **Qdrant** (vectors) + **Langfuse** (observability, self-host Docker) + **n8n** (workflows) + **OpenClaw** (agent runtime). GPU recommendations: 2× RTX 4090 (24GB each = 48GB) for 70B models; single RTX 4090 for 27B.

### 📊 Evaluation & Monitoring

**I want to evaluate agent output quality**
→ **DeepEval** (rich metric suite: faithfulness, relevancy, hallucination) + **Langfuse** (traces + evals). For custom: **LangSmith** (tight LangChain integration). Open-source: **Agenta** (self-host).

**I want to debug why my agent is failing**
→ **Langfuse** (trace each tool call + LLM call with timing) + **Arize Phoenix** (root cause analysis). Enable verbose logging in your framework (LangGraph / CrewAI all support it). Use **LLM-as-judge** to flag low-confidence steps.

**I want to monitor production agents in real-time**
→ **Langfuse** (OpenTelemetry-native, self-host) or **Helicone** (zero-latency proxy logging). Set up cost + latency + error-rate dashboards. Alert on error spikes via **Grafana** or **Datadog** integration.

**I want to A/B test different models or prompts**
→ **Braintrust** (experiment tracking, online/offline eval) or **LangSmith** (prompt playground + evals). For open-source: **Agenta** + **Langfuse** experiments feature.

**I want to benchmark models on my specific tasks**
→ **LMSYS Chatbot Arena** custom eval + **Evals by OpenAI** (open framework) + **DeepEval** (custom metric). Run your own eval harness: prepare 50–200 golden examples, measure precision/recall on your actual task.

**I want to evaluate MCP server security**
→ **mcp-scan** (Invariant Labs) — Detects prompt injection, tool poisoning, shadow tools in MCP servers. Run before production deployment. See also: [Agent Security](#️-agent-security).

## ⚠️ Anti-Picks — What NOT to Use For…

*Avoid common mistakes. These recommendations are based on observed production failures in 2026.*

| ❌ Don’t Use | ❌ For This | ✅ Use Instead | Why |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| LangChain v0.x | New production agents | **LangGraph** | LangChain chains are deprecated; LangGraph has proper state management |
| AutoGPT (legacy) | Production workloads | **OpenHands** or **LangGraph** | AutoGPT’s 2023 architecture has poor reliability at scale |
| GPT-3.5-Turbo | Complex reasoning | **Gemini 2.5 Flash** or **Claude Haiku 4.5** | GPT-3.5 deprecated, same cost range as modern models |
| Pinecone Starter | Self-hosted / cost-sensitive | **Qdrant** or **pgvector** | Pinecone Starter tier removed 2025; OSS alternatives are cheaper |
| LLM for real-time stock trading | Financial execution | **Deterministic rule engine** | LLMs hallucinate numbers; catastrophic for live trading |
| ChatGPT Plus | Production API workflows | **OpenAI API** direct | ChatGPT Plus is consumer; no SLA, no rate control, no observability |
| Hugging Face Inference API (free) | Production load | **Modal** or **self-hosted Ollama** | Free tier has extreme rate limits, cold starts >30s |
| Autonomous agents without human-in-loop | Medical / legal decisions | Any model + **mandatory human review step** | No current model is reliable enough for high-stakes autonomous decisions |
| PDF viewer MCP for sensitive docs | Compliance environments | **Local LlamaIndex + on-prem Qdrant** | Sending sensitive PDFs to cloud MCP servers violates data residency rules |
| CrewAI for single-agent tasks | Simple one-shot tasks | **Direct API call** | CrewAI’s multi-agent overhead adds latency and cost when only one agent is needed |
| Midjourney | Programmatic / API image gen | **gpt-image-2** or **Flux 2 Pro API** | Midjourney has no public API; requires Discord bot workaround |
| GPT-4o Vision for OCR | High-accuracy document OCR | **Tesseract 5** + **Azure Document Intelligence** | LLM OCR has ~2-5% error rate; dedicated OCR is 10x cheaper and more accurate |
| Sora | Any video generation (2026) | **Kling VIDEO 3.0** or **Veo 3.1** | Sora discontinued by OpenAI, April 2026 |
| Vector DB without reranking | High-precision RAG | Vector DB + **BGE reranker** or **Cohere Rerank** | Raw vector search recall is ~70%; reranking brings it to ~90%+ |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite | Complex legal/medical reasoning | **Claude Opus 4.7** or **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | Flash-Lite optimized for speed, not accuracy on high-stakes tasks |
